## Phonegap / Cordova Plugin

This repository contains the Weemo Phonegap / Cordova Plugin. More information about Weemo SDKs can be found at [http://www.weemo.com/](http://www.weemo.com/)

The use cases have been minimized in order to reduce the integration effort while creating a functional model for the POC that covers most of the use cases for audio and video during 1:1 calls.
Basic implemented functions into this example are: 

- Initialization and Cloud authentification
- Send or Receive a call by UID  
- Start a call window that displays video
- Mute or Unmute audio

For implementation details, please refer to the [project wiki](https://github.com/weemo/Phonegap-SDK/wiki) and to the detailed [API Reference](http://docs.weemo.com/sdk/phonegap/) documentation.

## Get the library

Please refer to the [setup documention](https://github.com/weemo/Phonegap-SDK/wiki#setup) to intergate this plugin into your hybrid project.
